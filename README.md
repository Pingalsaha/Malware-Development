The "Malware-Development" project was developed using C++ to create sophisticated malware and C to analyze various virus categories. This project explores the creation of advanced malware designed to simulate real-world threats, allowing for the study and understanding of security vulnerabilities. By developing and analyzing different types of malicious software, the project aims to enhance the understanding of malware behavior, attack vectors, and potential security breaches. This research is intended for advanced security analysis, testing defensive measures, and improving cybersecurity strategies against evolving threats.
